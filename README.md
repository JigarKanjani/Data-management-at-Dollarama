# Data-management-at-Dollarama
About This Capstone Project

This repository showcases my Capstone project, which I have worked on as part of my Data Science class under the guidance of Junaid Qazi. The project focused on optimizing data management and leveraging cloud architecture for a retail company, Dollarama. Through this project, I gained valuable insights into the intricacies of data pipelines, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, and the strategic implementation of Microsoft Azure's cloud services. The most interesting aspect of this project was the opportunity to delve into real-world applications of data management and cloud computing, witnessing how these technologies can drive operational efficiency, enhance customer experiences, and foster data-driven decision-making.

I am thrilled to have completed this Capstone project, as it has solidified my understanding of data management practices and cloud architectures. Moreover, it has ignited my excitement to further explore and work on more comprehensive projects that harness the power of cutting-edge technologies. I look forward to continuing my learning journey and contributing to innovative solutions that leverage data and cloud computing to drive business success.
